# SamBot Simulation
Simulation is performed within Unreal Engine 5, for ease of use, Python and C++ support, and host of relevant tools.

## Current Status
Currently the SamBot "Actor" has realistic joints for wheels and Lidar spin. The current objective is to implement radial force to these joints as needed.
